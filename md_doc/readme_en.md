# Uni-Robot


UniRobot is an embodied intelligence software framework that integrates a robot brain (data, models, model training) with a robot body (perception, model inference, control). This framework provides the following capabilities:

- Distributed training capability for embodied models

- High-performance inference services for embodied models

- Abstract software framework for robot bodies

- Full closed-loop pipeline from robot data collection to training and inference

Meanwhile, UniRobot can serve the following groups:

- Provides model developers with convenient, high-performance model training toolchains and basic model components.

- Provides robot software development engineers with an abstract robot software framework.

- Provides data collection personnel with a full-chain data closed-loop toolchain.
